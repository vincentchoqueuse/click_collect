# <h1 align="center">Click and Collect App</h1>

## Context

The health crisis has confirmed the need to accelerate the digitization of very small businesses to increase their resilience.
At the same time, computer training (diploma and non-diploma) has developed considerably in recent years. Students currently in training (frontend, backend or UX design developer) represent an important strike force in the field of IT.

&nbsp;

## Our objective

The objective of this project is to connect VSEs and IT learners. The interest of this connection is twofold:

- Allow very small businesses to experiment and deploy small click & collect type projects quickly and free of charge

- Allow learners to apply their skills on concrete projects and to develop, at the same time, their pedagogy.

&nbsp;

This small project use the Django web framework and bootstrap.
The cart is stored in the session backend and save in database only after customers validations.
